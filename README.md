# Gotta Smash 'em All!
The name says it all: you get pokemons and you smash em the nice way (or pass, but why would you?)

## What?
GTFO~

## Why?
I forced my friends to play smash or pass with me, but sending pictures in a GC and waiting for them to come around wasn't fun enough so, yeah

## Development roadmap
This is a list of features that I am going to implement

### 0.1.0
The meat and bones, the essential, the prototype
- [X] Allow smashing and passing
- [X] Show a list tiny sprites of `the smashed ones`

### 0.2.0
The obviously solicited features
- [ ] Show extra information like`types` `weight` `height` `species`, so that people can make educated decisions about what pokemons to smash
- [ ] Allow sharing list of `the smashed ones`
- [ ] Allow changing decisions (we all second guess are decisions, let me enable you)
- [ ] Keyboard and mouse shortcuts, so that you can smash em faster
- [ ] Show mega evolutions and alternate forms too

### 0.3.0
Make it look and feel nice
- [ ] Actually make a UI
- [ ] Allow tinder-esque swipe-to-smash control

### 1.0.0
If I couldn't come up with anything else, I will make the latest realease the 1.0.0 release

## Contribution
Contributions are nice (and I am lazy af) so I would love them. However, as of right now, the code organisation is... sub par... to say the least
To avoid conflicts, I wont be accepting contribs until 1.0.0 is released, after which it's all yours to smash

## Shameless Ko-Fi plug?
Not now, but not never X3
